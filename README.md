# EefFox
My FirefoxCSS setup
Intended to look similar to Arc

## Setup
[Here](https://mrotherguy.github.io/ToyfoCSS/) is a good, thorough FirefoxCSS tutorial. 
To get this setup working, set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true` in `about:config`.
Then go to `about:support` and open the folder for your profile. You can either copy [the CSS](userChrome.css)
into this folder or clone this repo into it. Make sure you restart Firefox afterwards for it to apply.

## TODOs
- [ ] Add Sidebery CSS
